Notes from 03-23: 
- Have the day / night mode switch be more playful of a thing, 
- more showy, maybe light mode is more joker colors and the dark mode is the lavendar 
- find alternate options for the fonts offered: 
    - Ruthie
    - Eater
    - Qwitcher Grypen
- photos with info blocks, maybe a rotating carousel of photos
- photo 50% text 50% on desktop 
  - reactive on mobile, probably inline 
- Having photos that relate to the sections of the webpage 
- also a gallery page with all photos on the website 
- establish nav bar multiple pages 
- one more in-depth about me page linked on hompage about section 
- add some kind of fuzzy or scanlines or drippy something
