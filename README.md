Notes from 03-23: 
- photo 50% text 50% on desktop 
  - ~~reactive on mobile, probably inline~~
  
- ~~nav bar - multiple pages~~
  
- Have the day / night mode switch be more playful of a thing, 
  - lamp and sunglasses?
- more showy, maybe light mode is more joker colors and the dark mode is the lavendar 
  - light mode setup as the joker palette 
- add some kind of fuzzy or scanlines or drippy something   

     
- find alternate options for the fonts offered: 
    - Ruthie
    - Eater
    - Qwitcher Grypen
    
- photos with info blocks, maybe a rotating carousel of photos
  - sample carousel setup, will this work for larger amount of photos? 
- Having photos that relate to the sections of the webpage 
- ~~also a gallery page with all photos on the website~~ 
    
- ~~one more in-depth about me page linked on hompage about section~~
